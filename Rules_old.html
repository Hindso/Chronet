                <li>You can not kill unarmed people in raids, unless they are interfering or calling the cops. Tell them to face the wall and cooperate or to move out of the way. If they disobey your commands or if they block doors or interfere, you are free to kill them. This does not apply to the owners of a base you raid.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The player(s) being raided must obey the following the rules while the raid is in process:

                  <ol>
                    <li>This includes the usage of the player's keyboard   number pad, keypads and buttons. </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>You may not rebuild or repair your base while a raid is taking place.</li>
                <li>Do not lock spam. This is defined as repeatedly hitting your lock key while someone is lockpicking your door</li>
                <li>Do not door spam.  This is defined as repeatedly press E on a door that is unlocked, therefore disabling the raiders to enter.</li>
                <li>Shooting windows may only be 'activated' or 'faded' once every 5 seconds. (Ie. The cooldown period between pressing the button attached to your shooting windows' fading door is 5 seconds)</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Police Raids
              <ol>
                <li>You may not raid somebody purely based on sounds/effect created by items.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>General Street Crime
                <ol>
                  <li>You may only commit street crime in realistic situations.
                    <ol>
                      <li>This includes realistic areas and enviroments. (Eg. A realistic time to commit street crime would be at night. There would be little or mininal witnesses.)</li>
                      <li>As a criminal, one of your primary objectives is to not get caught. Do not commit crime in the middle of the day in plain sight of police officers and/or multiple witnesses.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Do not steal, rob, extort, etc without a valid RP reason.</li>
                  <li>Do not Fail RP. All criminals have a background story of some kind. If you are a 'low-end catburglar' criminal, you will not be in a huge base with the latest weapons and tech.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Hostages
                <ol>
                  <li>Hostages must be tied with a rope.
                    <ol>
                      <li>Be realistic when tied. Although the gamemode blocks you from doing certain things, refrain from doing unrealistic things when tied.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>You may roleplay to take all items from a hostage (Unless they say otherwise, do not power game)</li>
                  <li>The maximum ransom amount you can ask for is $2000. (Or $10 000 city funds)</li>
                  <li>Do not run away while a gun is being pointed at you. This is breaking FearRP.</li>
                  <li>Once your demands/ransom have been met, you must release the hostage.</li>
                  <li>You must have a good roleplay reason to hold somebody hostage. Don't randomly take people hostage.</li>
                  <li>After 10 minutes, the hostage(s) may choose to no longer participate in the hostage situation. You must let them go if they wish to leave after 10 minutes. </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Mugging
                <ol>
                  <li>As with street crime, you may only mug players in realistic areas. (Eg. A dark alley way where no other people are)</li>
                  <li>You may only mug a player for $200 at once.</li>
                  <li>You may not mug the same person within 30 minutes.</li>
                </ol>

          <li><strong>Random Deathmatch</strong> <br />

                              <li>If the Mayor has been in power for 10 or more minutes and has caused the economy to loose a large amount of economy points and is now less than 0 points. (Ie. Less than half the economy bar)</li>
                              <li>If the Mayor keeps the taxes high for a long period of time and rejects peoples complains of them being too high.</li>
                              <li>If you are roleplaying kidnapping the Mayor (For a good roleplay reason or a reason specified above) and the Mayor does not meet your demands or the Police do not obey your commands.</li>
