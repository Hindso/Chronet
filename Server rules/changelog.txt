Changelog update pushed on 13/06/2016

Features:
Changed expand/collapse all menu to hide unless the cursor is near the bottom of the screen.
	Also added a check which should hopefully prevent them from malfunctioning, although I can't locally replicate the bugs anyway
Fixed the rule number prepending applying to lists not in the rules (e.g. the side menu)
Fixed typos
	Credit to @Chance for spotting one
Attempted to add feature which automatically inserts the date at which the rules were last updated
	Will see if it works properly when it's live
		It's not throwing any errors, just that it doesn't have access, which shouldn't be a problem when it's hosted on the server itself
Fixed base construction example images being renamed incorrectly



Rules:
Added rule specifically against limiting what weapons can penetrate props
Clarified rule regarding the player's ability to get into a vehicle while being detained
Changed rule regarding the theft of job-specific vehicles
	Rule now concerns the theft of all vehicles
	You may only steal a person's vehicle if you already have the right to kill them
	Civilians may not respawn their stolen or impounded vehicles
	Owners of job-specific vehicles may respawn their vehicles
Added an example of powergaming. I'm not entirely sure that it's 100% clear, but I wanted to keep it brief
Added rules on the legalisation of marijuana
Added rules prohibiting the creation of sovereign nations / self-governing bodies without the permission of an online admin
Added rule against the trading of in-game currency for real money etc
