			<li class="rulesheader">General guidelines</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Every player is expected to have read all of the rules before playing on the server.
					<ul>
						<li>It might take a few minutes, but a ban will likely be a lot longer than that.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>It is expected that common sense will be employed by each player when playing on our server, as the rules cannot cover every single aspect of playing on a roleplay server.</li>
				<li>You will notice that &quot;realistically acceptable&quot; is used a lot in qualifying justifications, this is relatively self-explanatory, but is meant to mean that you must be able to do a similar action in real life and be able to justify it to others.</li>
				<li>Similarly, there is a significant focus on not being &quot;unfair&quot;, this is in the spirit that everybody should be able to enjoy their time on the server, without being disadvantaged by other players.</li>
				<li>If you try to look for loopholes in the rules, you are not playing in the spirit of the server.</li>
				<li>The admin's word is always final.
					<ul>
						<li>If an admin has said you're doing something wrong, you should listen, and try to correct yourself.</li>

			<li class="rulesheader">1. Chat and communication</li>
			<ul>
				<li>You must respect your fellow players on the server.</li>
				<li>You may not misuse any forms of communication on the server, such as using &quot;/advert&quot; for non-business purposes, metagaming in OOC chat, or talking in-character while you are unconscious.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="advanced" id="chat">
			<ul>
				<li>In general, players may not do any of the following:</li>
				<ol id="1.">
					<li>1. Flame each other.
						<ul>
							<li>Flaming is a hostile and insulting interaction between people, often involving the use of profanity.</li>
							<li>Flaming is an argument that becomes nasty or derisive, where insulting a party to the discussion takes precedence over the objective merits of one side or another.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>2. Disrespect other players on the server.</li>
					<li>3. Argue unnecessarily or excessively.</li>
					<li>4. Discriminate against others, including racism, homophobia, and sexism.

					</li>
					<li>5. Spam in any form.</li>
					<li>6. Advertise other servers.</li>
					<li>7. Prevent an admin from being able to properly perform their duties.

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>8. Misuse the admin chat (&quot;@ &laquo;message&raquo;&quot;).
						<ul>
							<li>This includes using it to say &quot;to me&quot; or &quot;help&quot;, your message should briefly describe the problem.</li>
							<li>You should not message the admins regarding a rulebreaking of which there is no evidence.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>9. Misuse voice chat. This includes:
						<ul>
							<li>Spamming the microphone in any way.</li>
							<li>Continuing to make inappropriate or irritating sounds after someone has complained.</li>
							<li>Playing music, except if you are roleplaying with the music (e.g. playing music on stage).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>10. Metagame. This includes:
						<ul>
							<li>Using out-of-character (OOC) knowledge to roleplay.
								<ul>
									<li>This includes sounds that your character would not realistically be able to hear (e.g. somebody using items from their inventory, or small sounds through a thick wall).</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Using OOC forms of communication (e.g. OOC chat) to communicate in-character.</li>
							<li>Using in-character forms of communication (e.g. &quot;/advert&quot;) to communicate out-of-character.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>11. Misuse party chat. This includes:
						<ul>
							<li>Using the party chat for OOC communication.</li>
							<li>Breaking any of the previously mentioned communication rules in party chat.</li>

			<li class="rulesheader">2. General roleplay</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Roleplay must be conducted in a reasonably realistic manner; you must respond to situations realistically, which includes valuing your own life.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="advanced" id="roleplay">
			<ul>
				<li>In general, bad, unfair, or &#39;fail&#39; roleplay is not allowed, which includes the following:</li>
				<ol id="2.">
					<li>1. Continuously breaking laws to get attention from the police.</li>
					<li>2. Running or driving away from the police for petty crimes (e.g. breaking a window or running a red light).</li>
					<li>3. Doing something completely unrealistic.</li>
					<li>4. Scamming players.</li>
					<li>5. Punch whoring.
						<ul>
							<li>This means randomly punching someone.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>6. Not valuing your own life (often called breaking &#39;Fear RP&#39;).
						<ul>
							<li>You must roleplay realistically, which includes roleplaying duress, and being afraid when a gun is pointed at you.</li>
							<li>You cannot unholster your gun if someone is already aiming theirs at you.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>7. Stealing a person's gun or item over the counter in a shop.</li>
					<li>8. Starting fires without good reason.</li>
					<li>9. Using any form of in-character communication while your character is unconscious or dead.
						<ul>
							<li>This includes party chat or private messages (PMs), which are strictly in-character forms of communication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>10. Powergaming.
						<ul>
							<li>Powergaming is forcing your roleplay onto others.</li>
							<li>For example, forcing a police officer to accept a fake ID.</li>
							<li>When conflict arises over how roleplay should proceed, the &quot;/roll&quot; feature should be used.</li>
							<li>As part of this, you may not force players to drop items from their inventory.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>11. Using an unrealistic roleplay name.
						<ul>
							<li>You may not name yourself after a celebrity, or use a name that closely resembles that of a celebrity (i.e. swapping or changing a few letters).</li>
							<li>Your name must not contain any proper or common nouns, verbs, adjectives, or offensive language.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>12. Misusing vehicles.
						<ul>
							<li>This includes driving erratically.</li>
							<li>Even if not explicitly stated in the laws, basic traffic laws apply.</li>
							<li>You must roleplay around vehicles realistically.
								<ul>
									<li>You may not get into the driver or passenger seats of a vehicle while in the process of being detained.</li>
									<li>You may not jump into a vehicle just as the owner unlocks it.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>You may not respawn your vehicle if it has been stolen or impounded.
								<ul>
									<li>This does not apply to owners of job-specific vehicles, who may respawn their vehicle.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>13. Creating your own sovereign nation or self-governing body.
						<ul>
							<li>This may only be done with the permission of an admin who is online at the time.</li>
							<li>This applies to any form of group or community that attempts to remove itself from under the jurisdiction of the government of Rockford.</li>
							<li>This also applies to players trying to wall off a part of the map, obstructing access to public areas.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>14. Vigilantism.
						<ul>
							<li>Civilians may not take the enforcement of the law into their own hands.</li>
							<li>This includes acting in the defence of government officials.</li>

							<ul>
								<li>You must be a law enforcement officer, and give them a chance to surrender themselves first.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>3. Someone asked you to.
							<ul>
								<li>Players are allowed to place hits on other players, but must be allowed to kill the player themselves to be allowed to order a hit on the player.</li>
								<li>If somebody has asked you to kill another player and you are unsure of their justification, ask an admin, or don't carry out the hit.</li>
								
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>4. You wanted to, although had no realistically acceptable reason to do so.</li>

			</ul>
			<div class="advanced" id="crime">
			<ul>
				<li>The following crime-specific rules must be obeyed:</li>
				<ol id="10.">
					<li>1. You may not steal or hijack a person's vehicle unless you already have a realistically acceptable reason to kill them.
						<ul>
							<li>This includes players who you have just killed.</li>
							<li>Players whose job-specific vehicle has been stolen may respawn their vehicle.
								<ul>
									<li>This is because it prevents them from being able to do their job effectively.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>See the Random Deathmatch section for rules on when it is acceptable to kill someone.</li>

					</li>
					<li>2. When commiting general street crime, the following rules must be obeyed:</li>
					<ol id="10.2.">
						<li>1. Players must seek to minimise the potential number of witnesses to their crimes.
							<ul>
								<li>This means you must pick a suitable time and location (e.g. in an alleyway, or late at night and away from streetlights).</li>
								<li>This does not mean you can kill witnesses.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>3. When taking a hostage, the following rules must be obeyed:</li>
					<ol id="10.3.">
						<li>1. Hostages must be tied with rope.
							<ul>
								<li>Roleplay reaslistically when tied.</li>
								<li>Although gamemode mechanics block you from performing certain actions when tied, refrain from doing anything unrealistic.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>2. You may roleplay taking the equipped and holstered items from a tied hostage.
							<ul>
								<li>This means you may roleplay taking their phone, and any other communication devices, so they cannot call the police.</li>
								<li>You may not force the player to drop items from their inventory.</li>
								<li>When a hostage is not suitably controlled (e.g. they're not tied), they may resist. The &quot;/roll&quot; command should be used in these situations.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>3. You may not ransom a hostage for more than $2000, or $10000 in city funds.</li>
						<li>4. You must release the hostage once your demands have been met.
							<ul>
								<li>You may not kill the hostage.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>5. You must have a realistically acceptable reason to take someone as a hostage.
							<ul>
								<li>You may not take someone as a hostage for the ransom alone.</li>
								<li>Generally, this means you may only take people hostage for whom you have a legitimate reason to kill.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>6. You must release the hostage if they wish to leave after 10 minutes of being a hostage.
							<ul>
								<li>It is your responsibility to ensure that your hostage knows this is an option to them.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>7. You may not take another hostage for 30 minutes after releasing your previous hostage.</li>
					</ol>
					<li>4. When mugging someone, the following rules must be obeyed:</li>
					<ol id="10.4.">
						<li>1. You may only mug people under realistic conditions.
							<ul>
								<li>As with street crime, you must pick a suitable time and location, so as to minimise the potential number of witnesses.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>2. You may only mug a player for $200 at any one time.
							<ul>
								<li>Any more than that and the player is allowed to use &quot;/me&quot; to drop the money.
									<ul>
										<li>Once again, it is your responsibility to ensure that the mugging victim knows this is an option to them.</li>
									</ul>
